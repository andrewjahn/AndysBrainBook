TBSS #1: Download and Install
=============================

--------

Before you Begin
****************


TBSS comes with the `FSL software package <https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSL>`__, which is covered in a :ref:`previous tutorial <fMRI_Intro>`. If you haven't used FSL before, I recommend reviewing that module to become familiar with it; the following chapters assume that you know how to use basic FSL commands, as well as the FSL viewer, `FSLeyes <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVYHFQedAXA>`__.


Installing FSL
--------------

FSL can be installed on different operating systems, such as Windows, Macintosh, and Linux. The Windows version requires a virtual machine to run FSL. This course will assume that you have a Macintosh or Linux operating system, and the tutorials will be recorded using an iMac desktop.

The instructions for installing FSL on different operating systems can be found `here <https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation>`__.
The instructions are detailed and will not be repeated here; but for those who are using a Macintosh computer, 
a screencast can be found here to walk you through the installation and setup: 
`FSL Installation Video Walkthrough <https://youtu.be/E9FwDCYAto8?t=16>`__.


.. warning::

  You may come across the following error when running fslinstaller.py: [FAILED] [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:661). In that case, try running the installer by specifying the absolute path to your python command, e.g.: ``/usr/bin/python fslinstaller.py``.
