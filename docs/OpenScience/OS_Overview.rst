This module contains chapters on different aspects of open science - method of sharing data that make analyses more transparent and reproducible.

We are looking for graduate students, postdocs, and other members of the Open Science community to contribute articles about how to perform different open science techniques. Although the articles are hosted on this site, full credit will be given to those who contribute their writing.
