What is SPM?
*****************

`SPM <https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/>`__ (Statistical Parametric Mapping) is an fMRI analysis software package that is run in `Matlab <https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html>`__. In addition to fMRI analysis, SPM contains toolboxes for performing volume based morphometry and effective connectivity.

The following tutorials will show you how to analyze a sample dataset with SPM. You will begin by learning the fundamentals of fMRI preprocessing, and then proceed to create a model. We will finish by learning about different types of group analyses, and how to do region of interest (ROI) analyses.
