Overview of Seed-Based d Mapping
********************************

Instead of using the maps generated by GingerALE, which determined significant overlap based on p-values, we could use permutation testing, a technique that is more robust to outliers and any violations of the assumption of normality, and which uses the data itself to construct a null distribution. For those who prefer this method, we will learn how to use a package called `Seed-Based d Mapping <https://www.sdmproject.com/>`__, a free, open-source software package that can be used with SPM.
