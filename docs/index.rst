Welcome to Andy's Brain Book!
=============================

.. figure:: ABB_logo_book.png

    This resource is sponsored by the `University of Michigan <https://umich.edu/>`__.

Hello! This book, *Andy's Brain Book*, is the ReadTheDocs companion
to `Andy's Brain Blog <https://www.andysbrainblog.com>`__. It is intended for fMRI beginners, with more advanced imaging techniques being added later on. If this is your first time here, watch `this video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUxOdq3sAFU>`__ for a quick overview of the website.

This book, *Andy's Brain Book*, is intended for fMRI beginners, with more advanced imaging techniques being added later on.

If you are completely new to fMRI analysis, I recommend starting with the :ref:`installation page <fsl_mac_install>`. Good luck!

.. note::

    Reading this book is easier with a slightly larger font size; I recommend using a zoom of 125%. You can do this on a Macintosh by holding down the ``Command`` key and pressing ``+``, or from the browser menu you can click on ``View -> Zoom In``.

.. note::
    This book is under construction. More chapters will be added in the coming weeks; my goal is to have a complete draft of the fMRI Short Course by the first week of June.
    
    4.24.2019: Finished the sections Unix Tutorial #4, fMRI Short Course chapters on smoothing and quality checking FEAT output, and added a playlist covering all of the sections done in the Preprocessing module.
    
    5.06.2019: Added sections to FAQ about resampling, biased analyses, and flipped orientations. Wrote the chapters for the Statistics part of the short course; videos coming soon.
    
    5.25.2019: Finished the Unix Module, and added videos for 2nd and 3rd level analysis in the fMRI short course.
    
    5.31.2019: First draft of the Unix and fMRI courses are complete.
    
    10.14.2019: E-Prime module is complete.

    10.16.2019: FreeSurfer module complete.
    
    1.13.2020: SPM written module complete (videos not up yet)
    
    4.13.2020: SPM videos uploaded

    5.21.2020: CONN Tutorials complete
    
    12.08.2020: First part of MVPA tutorial complete, from preprocessing to group-level analysis. Later on, will add other statistical analyses, such as prevalence analysis.
    
    01.20.2022: There is now a DOI for Andy's Brain Book! If you would like to cite it, use the following template: "We followed the AFNI preprocessing pipeline as outlined in Andy's Brain Book (Jahn, 2022. doi:10.5281/zenodo.5879293)."
