Control Statements
******************

Now that you understand the basics of Python, we can use more advanced functions such as for-loops and conditional statements. These so-called *control statements* have been covered in the Unix and Matlab tutorial of this e-book, and for a more detailed summary of what they are, the reader is directed to those chapters.

To recapitulate, control statements direct the flow of variables and information within a Python script. You can think of them as analogous to traffic signs: They direct you where to go, when to speed up or slow down, and in general they control the flow of traffic. The two most common control statements you will come across are for-loops and conditional statements, which we now turn to.
