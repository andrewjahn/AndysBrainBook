Object-Oriented Programming
***************************

Python is an object-oriented programming language, meaning that it primarily involves creating and manipulating objects. For example, we might create a circle as an object, and define certain characteristics: For example, its radius and circumference. We can then extend this concept to other objects, such as the images we use for fMRI analysis.

In the previous chapter, we learned the basics of Jupyter notebooks and began with assigning a value to a variable - that is, an object which can take any range of possible values. We now proceed to other *types* of variables, specifically built-in ones that come with Python by default. And the most common ones are integers, strings, and booleans.

Built-in Types
**************

Let's being with integers. These are any whole numbers (i.e., not fractions or numbers that contain a decimal).
