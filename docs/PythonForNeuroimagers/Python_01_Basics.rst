The Python Environment
**********************

My recommendation is to use Jupyter notebooks for learning Python, and to use them within Neurodesk. One of the major problems that newcomers run into is incorrect versions of Python; for example, you may want to use a certain version of Nilearn, but it is not supported by the version of Python that you are using. An environment like Neurodesk takes care of these version issues for you, and makes the experience much smoother.

Another option is to use **conda** to create what is called a virtual environment. The idea is similar to those of containers, which are environments that are segregated from your local machine; that is, any software installed on your local machine won't affect what is in your virtual environment, and vice versa.
