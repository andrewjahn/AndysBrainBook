Overview of Classes
*******************

For the casual Python user, or for the student who just wants to understand enough Python to know how to use the scripts that he downloads from Github, the preceding concepts are probably enough to get started. In order to write more advanced scripts and have greater flexibility for what you can do with Python, you will need to understand something called **Classes**.

As Python is an object-oriented programming language, virtually all of the code you work with in Python can be thought of as an object. And just as certain objects in everyday life can be placed in distinct categories, so can the objects in Python belong to specific classes. For example, think of an object such as a pencil. Some pencils are made of wood and graphite, while others are mechanical pencils made of plastic. Some pencils have sharper points, while others are more blunted. But they all share the common properties of being a handheld tool used for writing.

In the same way, Classes in Python can be thought of as templates for objects.
